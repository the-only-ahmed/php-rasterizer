<- Vertex ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vertex class handles Vertex.

An instance can be contructed from either coordonate (x, y, z, w [optional]) and a class color
[optional]:
new Vertex( array( 'x' => 1, 'y' => 1, 'z' => 1, 'w' => 1, new Color (See doc
color class) ) );

The class provides the following methods :

GetX
For have the x value.
GetY
For have the y value.
GetZ
For have the z value.
GetW
For have the w value.
GetColor
For have the Color value.

magnitude
Return the magnitude of the vector's instance.

normalize
Return the normalization of the vector's instance.

add
Return the addition of the vector's instance and the vector's param. (Take a
vector in param)

sub
Return the sub of the vector's instance and the vector's param. (Take a vector
in param)

opposite
Return the opposite of the vector's instance.

scalarProduct
Return the scalar product of the vector's instance, by the variable param. (Take
a variable in param)

dotProduct
Return the dot product of the vector's instance by the vector's param. (Take a
vector in param.)

cos
Return the cosinus of the vector's param by the vector's instance. (Take a
vector in param)

crossProduct
Return the cross product (Right Hand) of the vector's instance by the
vector's param. (Take a vector in param)
